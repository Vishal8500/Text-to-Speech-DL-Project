# Text-to-Speech-DL-Project
This project improves Text-to-Speech (TTS) by using an attention mechanism to align text with speech, ensuring accurate pronunciation, natural prosody, and smooth transitions. It resolves issues like word skipping and overemphasis, delivering human-like speech with low latency, ideal for voice synthesis and assistive tech.
